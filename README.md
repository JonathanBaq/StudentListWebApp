# WebApp

I made this WebApp on a Programming course at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki. 
A lot of notations on the code are also from the instructor as some of the project is pre-built by him to help us in starting off. 

It is a simple web application that shows a list of students and you can add, delete and update student information.

## Stack 
* HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the client side
* Java Servlets, Data Access Objects (DAO) using the JDBC API and GSON library for the server side
* SQlite for the database, Apache Tomcat for the Web Server
