# WebApp

I made this WebApp on a Programming course at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki. 
A lot of notations on the code are also from the instructor as some of the project is pre-built by him to help us in starting off. 

It is a simple web application that shows a list of students and you can add, delete and update student information.

The stack is HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the client side, Java Servlets and Data Access Objects using the JDBC API on the server side,
  and SQlite for the database.
